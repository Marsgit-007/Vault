| Read question first                                                                                                      | Don't skim through the passage so fast that you miss important key words                                                              |
| Identify key words in question                                                                                           | Find the right balance between reading quickly and taking in the important parts of the passage                                       |
| Then skim read the passage whilst looking for those key words                                                            | Make sure you don't skip over worlds like "not" - it will completely change the meaning of the question and the answer you search for |
| Always read around (the sentence above and below) the key words                                                          |                                                                                                                                       |
| Pay special attention to names, dates, places, people, numbers, shifts in thinking, changes, increases/decreases         |                                                                                                                                       |
| Be aware of "shifts" in the author's opinion                                                                             |                                                                                                                                       |
| Focus on questions that include the words "not", "least likely", and "cannot"                                            |                                                                                                                                       |
| If you come across an extremely long and complex passage, take a guess, flag the question and come back to it at the end |                                                                                                                                       |
