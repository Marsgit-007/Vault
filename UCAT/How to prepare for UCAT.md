1) **Understand the theory that underlies each of the 5 sections**
This is a test unlike what you have seen before (especially the abstract reasoning and situational judgement sections) so figuring out what the different questions are asking you to do and the strategies you can use to tackle them is an important step

2) **Do as many practice questions as possible**
It will be confusing at first until you do lots of questions. Practice is key to mastering this test

3) **Identify weaknesses**
After completing practice questions, go back to the questions you got wrong and identify weaknesses. Go back to the relevant theory for that section and relearn it before focusing on more practice questions to improve your scores for that sections

4) **Timed mock sections**
Once you feel confident in a section, move on to timed mock sections. Although timing yourself might seem stressful, it is very important to become accustomed to the time pressures for each section and being able to complete the questions under those constraints. Complete a timed mock for each of the 5 sections of the UCAT test before attempting a full timed mock test

5) **Full timed mock tests**
Completing a full timed mock test is crucial before sitting the real UCAT test. The first one will probably no go to well, but don't worry that's completely normal. Timing is a huge part of succeeding in the UCAT test and the more timed mocks you do, the more prepared you will be

6) **Nailing the timing**
After completing several full time mocks, you will be able to see which sections you need to work faster in order to complete all the questions on time. If there is a section that you continuously seem to run out of time, work through some practice questions whilst focusing on completing them as fast as you can (without compromising your accuracy)

7) **Practice, Practice, Practice**
At this stage, all that is left is to continue practicing for a few hours every day until your test day
