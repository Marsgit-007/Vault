+ Scan the passage for dates, numbers and capitalised words
+ Triage questions relating to the author's opinion or any tricky/long questions
+ If you scan for >30s and you're still unsure of the correct answer, guess, flag the question and move on
+ Questions regarding the common factors between two things are likely to be consuming so triage them
+ Simplify questions where possible into easier terms e.g. the question "Which of these assertions is best supported by information in the passage?" is essentially asking "Which assertion is true?"
+ If you thing 3 out of the 4 answers are false, then by default you know the fourth answer must be true. However, it will take you 2 seconds to read the fourth statement and you might realise that it is also false (based on the information you have read in the passage), then you must have made a mistake in one of the first 3 statements
+ If you're 90% sure about your answer, then select it and move on. Chances are you're right and you should be using the limited time on other questions that require more thinking and analysis
