+ When reading the question, get used to assessing how long you think it is going to take you and its complexity in order to determine whether you should triage it
+ flag and return to questions with 5-6 steps unless you know it's an easy mark (e.g. Calculating an average)
+ Triage questions that involve complicated/many calculations
+ Identify topics that you consistently make mistakes on or which you know are difficult for you and triage those questions the first time going through
+ Questions that you spend a lot of time trying to solve are often the questions you get wrong. These are worth triaging
+ During the 1 minute reading time before this section, write down all the equations you remember on your whiteboard, so you can easily refer to them when tackling the questions
+ Use the on-screen calculator from the beginning of your revision sessions. You need to become familiar with using it so that you don't waste any time inputting numbers during the actual test
+ If you can keep track of some numbers in your head during complex calculations instead of writing them down, it might increase your efficiency. Only do this if you are confident with you number-memory under time pressure. It is not worth saving those extra 1-2 seconds if it will cost you the mark
+ If you feel you've spend a lot of time on a question or you are getting stuck then take a guess, flag and move on. There are plenty of other questions around the corner that you will know how to solve
