| Use accurate numbers for calculations and keep rounding to a minimum                                                                                                                                                                | Don't over select the "Can't tell" option - it's easy to assume you don't have enough information to solve the question                                                                                          |
| memorise all the equations that come up frequently. It's important to know these off by heart and be able to use them appropriately                                                                                                 | Don't rush when estimating values from bar graphs or data plots as you don't ant to introduce too much error through your rounding. This is important as the answers are often very close in value to each other |
| If a questions asks you to eyeball a value from a graph, it's worth making sure you are reading the question and the graph correctly. This is one of the easier marks to get, so take a bit of extra time to make sure you're right |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| know your fractions, rations, conversions, probabilities, decimal places, percentages, mean, media and mode well. They come up in almost every question                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Read the question first and then look at the figures/graphs to extract relevant information                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| make it a point to reach the end of the section. Easier questions are sometimes towards the end so do your best to get to those questions                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
