+ "True" = SAME as passage
+ "False" = OPPOSITE to the passage
+ "Can't tell" = the passage does not give you enough information to draw a conclusion
+ Answers to questions that include the word "not" don't match the passage
+ "Some" = at least ONE
+ "Many" = the MAJORITY >50%
+ "All" = 100%
+ If the question makes a statement but the passage says "Maybe" or "There is not a lot of evidence" then the answer is "C - Can't tell" because you cannot directly draw a conclusion
+ If the passage talks about e.g. "the period 1920-1925" and the question asks about the "1920s" then the answer is "C - Can't tell" because the question is broader than the passage
+ Questions with the word  "except" are looking for the answer that is FALSE
+ If you can refute any part of the statement, then the answer is FALSE. The entire statement must be true in order for the answer to be TRUE
+ The author agrees with anything that matches the passage
+ The answer is "Can't tell" if you can't determine fi it's true or false based on the information given in the passage. If the passage gives you a reason contradictory to that stated in the question, the answer is FALSE
+ Pay special attention to the words "not", "except", "least" and "most"
