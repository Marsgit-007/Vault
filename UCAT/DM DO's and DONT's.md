| Have a well practiced strategy for each question type (Venn diagrams, logic puzzles, logical deduction, probability, analysis & interpretation)                                                                                       | Don't make any assumptions and don't jump to any conclusions. If you don't draw a conclusion based solely on the information presented to you in the passage, then you shouldn't make your own conclusion |
| For "select the strongest argument" questions, choose the statement that covers ALL parts of the passage. Pick answers based on statistics, evidence, facts, reports or studies rather than personal stories, assumptions or opinions | Don't forget to pay careful attention to the specific words used when statements are made. These words will often describe the likelihood of something occurring e.g. "commonly", "often", "rarely" etc   |
| Know how to solve popular topics e.g. Venn diagrams, basic probability calculations ("AND" = multiplying fractions/probabilities, "OR" = adding fractions/probabilities)                                                              | Don't be scared to use the whiteboard in this section. Small symbols or diagrams can go a long way in simplifying the complicated wording of the passage                                                  |
| Probability questions that require interpreting graphs are common. Practice extracting important information from figures quickly                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
