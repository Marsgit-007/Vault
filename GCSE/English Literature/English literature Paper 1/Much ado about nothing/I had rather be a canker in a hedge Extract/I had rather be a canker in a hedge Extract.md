### SCENE III. The same.

> _Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE_

**CONRADE**

> What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out  
> of measure sad?  

**DON JOHN**

> There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;  
> therefore the sadness is without limit.  

**CONRADE**

> You should hear reason.  

**DON JOHN**

> And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?  

**CONRADE**

> If not a present remedy, at least a patient  
> sufferance.  

**DON JOHN**

> I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,  
> born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral  
> medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide  
> what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile  
> at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait  
> for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and  
> tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and  
> claw no man in his humour.  

**CONRADE**

> Yea, but you must not make the full show of this  
> till you may do it without controlment. You have of  
> late stood out against your brother, and he hath  
> ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is  
> impossible you should take true root but by the  
> fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful  
> that you frame the season for your own harvest.  

**DON JOHN**

> <mark class="yellow">I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in</mark>  
> <mark class="yellow">his grace</mark>, and it better fits my blood to be  
> disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob  
> love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to  
> be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied  
> but <mark class="yellow">I am a plain-dealing villain</mark>. I am trusted with  
> a <mark class="yellow">muzzle</mark> and enfranchised with a <mark class="yellow">clog</mark>; therefore I  
> have decreed not to sing in my <mark class="yellow">cage</mark>. If I had my  
> mouth, I would <mark class="yellow">bite</mark>; if I had my liberty, I would do  
> my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and  
> seek not to alter me.
