**CLAUDIO**

> Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.  
> There, Leonato, take her back again:  
> Give not this <mark class="yellow">rotten orange</mark> to your friend;  
> <mark class="yellow">She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.</mark>  
> Behold how like a maid she blushes here!  
> O, what authority and show of truth  
> Can cunning sin cover itself withal!  
> Comes not that blood as modest evidence  
> To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,  
> All you that see her, that she were a maid,  
> By these exterior shows? But she is none:  
> <mark class="yellow">She knows the heat of a luxurious bed</mark>;  
> Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.  

**LEONATO**

> What do you mean, my lord?

**CLAUDIO**

> Not to be married,  
> Not to knit my soul to an <mark class="yellow">approved wanton</mark>.  

**LEONATO**

> Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,  
> Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,  
> And made defeat of her virginity,--  

**CLAUDIO**

> I know what you would say: if I have known her,  
> You will say she did embrace me as a husband,  
> And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:  
> No, Leonato,  
> I never tempted her with word too large;  
> But, as a brother to his sister, show'd  
> Bashful sincerity and comely love.
