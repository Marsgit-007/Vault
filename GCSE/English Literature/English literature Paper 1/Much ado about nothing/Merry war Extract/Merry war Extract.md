> I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior

**BENEDICK**

> What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?  

**BEATRICE**

> Is it possible disdain should die while she hath

> Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come

**BENEDICK**

> Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I

> would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard  
> heart; for, truly, I love none.  

**BEATRICE**

> A dear happiness to women: they would else have  
> been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God  
> and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I  
> had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man

**BENEDICK**

> God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some

> scratched face.  

**BEATRICE**

> Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such

**BENEDICK**

> Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.  

**BEATRICE**

> A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.  

**BENEDICK**

> I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and  
> so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's  
> name; I have done.  

**BEATRICE**

> You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
