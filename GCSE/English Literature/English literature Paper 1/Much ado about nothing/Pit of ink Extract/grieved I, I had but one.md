# Text Elements
"grieved I, I had but one" ^Q9FHNOC6

Through Leonato, Shakespeare highlights
how Elizabethan men equated a loss of honour with death and a loss of life. In this sense, Leonato can be seen to "grieve" the loss of his legacy and family name, now stained by the alleged actions of Hero ^iXa4yIGx

Metaphorical verb "grieved"
connotes a deep mourning of a loss often linked with death. 

Here Hero has metaphorically died in the sense that it is a death of her power, status, honour and role in society ^yRdE20Oa

Thus Shakespeare illustrates
that "honour" was seemingly the life of Elizabethan society and its subsequent loss is equated to a death - not only of the person shamed but also spreading to the family name ^aaEmjtX8

Repetition
of personal pronoun perhaps mirrors Leonato's self-centred attitude towards women.

There is no sense of care for Hero, only about himself and his reputation. Hero is his property and has shamed him - indelibly staining his legacy and family name ^bjKzWcZC

Additionally the metaphorical death
could link to the honour of Leonato's family line as now, dishonoured, the line has been indelibly stained and can no longer progress through marriage and heirs. 

The fact that Leonato only has "one" child links to Elizabethan laws of inheritance and passing down land and titles to heirs

Now dishonoured, Hero would be viewed as a "used body" and not fit to function as a wife ^yUhSFQDu
