**LEONATO**

> Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing  
> Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny  
> The story that is <mark class="yellow">printed in her blood</mark>?  
> <mark class="yellow">Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:</mark>  
> For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,  
> Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,  
> Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,  
> Strike at thy life.<mark class="yellow"> Grieved I, I had but one</mark>?  
> Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?  
> O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?  
> Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?  
> Why had I not with charitable hand  
> Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,  
> Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,  
> I might have said 'No part of it is mine;  
> This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?  
> <mark class="yellow">But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised</mark>  
> <mark class="yellow">And mine that I was proud on, mine so much</mark>  
> That I myself was to myself not mine,  
> Valuing of her,--why, she, O, <mark class="yellow">she is fallen </mark> 
> <mark class="yellow">Into a pit of ink</mark>, that the wide sea  
> Hath drops too few to wash her clean again  
> And salt too little which may season give  
> To her <mark class="yellow">foul-tainted flesh</mark>!
