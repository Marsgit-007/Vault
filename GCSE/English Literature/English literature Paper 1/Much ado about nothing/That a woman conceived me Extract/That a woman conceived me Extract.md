**BENEDICK**

> That a woman<mark class="yellow"> conceived me</mark>, I thank her; that she  
><mark class="yellow"> brought me up</mark>, I likewise give her most humble  
> thanks: but that I will have a<mark class="yellow"> recheat winded in my</mark>  
> <mark class="yellow">forehead</mark>, or <mark class="yellow">hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick</mark>,  
> all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do  
> them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the  
> right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which  
> I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.  

**DON PEDRO**

> I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.  

**BENEDICK**

> With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,  
> not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood  
> with love than I will get again with drinking, pick  
> out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me  
> up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of  
> blind Cupid.  

**DON PEDRO**

> Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou  
> wilt prove a notable argument.  

**BENEDICK**

> If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot  
> at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on  
> the shoulder, and called Adam.  

**DON PEDRO**

> Well, as time shall try: '<mark class="yellow">In time the savage bull</mark>  
> <mark class="yellow">doth bear the yoke</mark>.'  

**BENEDICK**

> The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible  
> Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set  
> them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,  
> and in such great letters as they write 'Here is  
> good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign  
> 'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'

[[Recheat winded on my forehead]]
[[Hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick]]
[[In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke]]
[[conceived me brought me up]]
