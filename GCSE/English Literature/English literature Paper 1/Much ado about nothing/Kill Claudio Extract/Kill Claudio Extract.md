**BENEDICK**

> Ha! not for the wide world.  

**BEATRICE**

> You kill me to deny it. Farewell.  

**BENEDICK**

**BEATRICE**

**BENEDICK**

> Beatrice,--  

**BEATRICE**

> In faith, I will go.  

**BENEDICK**

> We'll be friends first.  

**BEATRICE**

> You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.  

**BENEDICK**

> Is Claudio thine enemy?  

**BEATRICE**

> Is he not approved in the height a villain, that

**BENEDICK**

> Hear me, Beatrice,--  

**BEATRICE**

> Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!  

**BENEDICK**

> Nay, but, Beatrice,--  

**BEATRICE**

> Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.  

**BENEDICK**

> Beat--  

**BEATRICE**

> Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,  
> a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,

**BENEDICK**

> Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.  

**BEATRICE**

> Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.  

**BENEDICK**

> Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?  

**BEATRICE**

> Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.  

**BENEDICK**

> Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will  
> kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,  
> Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
