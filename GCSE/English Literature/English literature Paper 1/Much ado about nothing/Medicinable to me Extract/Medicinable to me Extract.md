> Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be

**BORACHIO**

> Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no

**DON JOHN**

> Show me briefly how.  

**BORACHIO**

> I think I told your lordship a year since, how much  
> I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting  
> gentlewoman to Hero.  

**DON JOHN**

> I remember.  

**BORACHIO**

> I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,  
> appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.  

**DON JOHN**

> What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?  

**BORACHIO**

> The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to  
> the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that  
> he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned  
> Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold  
> up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.  

**DON JOHN**

> What proof shall I make of that?  

**BORACHIO**

> Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,  
> to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any  
> other issue?  

**DON JOHN**

> Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.
