**BEATRICE**

> Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy

> that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else  
> make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please

**LEONATO**

> <mark class="yellow">Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband</mark>.  

**BEATRICE**

> Not till God make men of some other metal than

> No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;  
> and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.  
 
**LEONATO**

> Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince  
> do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.  

**BEATRICE**

> The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be  
> not wooed in good time: if the prince be too  
> important, tell him there is measure in every thing  
> and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:  
> wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,  
> a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot  
> and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as  
> fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a  
> measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes  
> repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the  
> cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.  

**LEONATO**

> Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.  

**BEATRICE**

> I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.
