**HERO**

> O god of love! I know he doth deserve  
> As much as may be yielded to a man:  
> But Nature never framed a woman's heart  
> Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;  
><mark class="yellow"> Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes</mark>,  
> Misprising what they look on, and her wit  
> Values itself so highly that to her  
> All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,  
> Nor take no shape nor project of affection,  
> She is so self-endeared.  

**URSULA**

> Sure, I think so;  
> And therefore certainly it were not good  
> She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.  

**HERO**

> Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,  
> How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,  
> But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,  
> She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;  
> If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,  
> Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;  
> If low, an agate very vilely cut;  
> If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;  
> If silent, why, a block moved with none.  
> So turns she every man the wrong side out  
> And never gives to truth and virtue that  
> Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.  

**URSULA**

> Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.  

**HERO**

> No, not to be so odd and from all fashions  
> As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:  
> But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,  
> She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me  
> Out of myself, press me to death with wit.  
> <mark class="yellow">Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,</mark>  
><mark class="yellow"> Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:</mark>  
> It were a better death than die with mocks,  
> Which is as bad as die with tickling.  

**URSULA**

> Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.  

**HERO**

> No; rather I will go to Benedick  
> And counsel him to fight against his passion.  
> And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders  
> To stain my cousin with: one doth not know  
> How much an ill word may empoison liking.  

**URSULA**

> O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.  
> She cannot be so much without true judgment--  
> Having so swift and excellent a wit  
> As she is prized to have--as to refuse  
> So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.  

**HERO**

> He is the only man of Italy.  
> Always excepted my dear Claudio.  

**URSULA**

> I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,  
> Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,  
> For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,  
> Goes foremost in report through Italy.  

**HERO**

> Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.  

**URSULA**

> His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.  
> When are you married, madam?  

**HERO**

> Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:  
> I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel  
> Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.  

**URSULA**

> She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.  

**HERO**

> If it proves so,<mark class="yellow"> then loving goes by haps:</mark>  
> <mark class="yellow">Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.  </mark>
> 
> _Exeunt HERO and URSULA_

**BEATRICE**

> [Coming forward]  
><mark class="yellow">What fire is in mine ears?</mark> Can this be true?  
> Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?  
> <mark class="yellow">Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!</mark>
> No glory lives behind the back of such.  
> And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,  
> <mark class="yellow">Taming my wild heart</mark> to thy loving hand:  
> If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee  
> To bind our loves up in a holy band;  
> For others say thou dost deserve, and I  
> Believe it better than reportingly.
