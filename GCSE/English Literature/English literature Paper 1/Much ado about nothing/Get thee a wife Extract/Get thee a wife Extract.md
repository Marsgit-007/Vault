**LEONATO**

> We'll have dancing afterward.  

**BENEDICK**

> First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,

> _Enter a Messenger_

**Messenger**

> My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,  
> And brought with armed men back to Messina.  

**BENEDICK**

> Think not on him till to-morrow:  
> I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.  
> Strike up, pipers.  
> 
> _Dance_
