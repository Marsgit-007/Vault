The next time I see a pet or animal
The next time I look at my face in a mirror 
The next time I turn on a light
The next time I see a flower

Monday
The next time I write anything down 
The next time I feel pain
The next time I hear someone say my name 
The next time I drink something

The next time I see a traffic light 
The next time I hear music
The next time I throw something in the garbage 
The next time I hear laughter

The next time I turn on a television or radio 
The next time I see a vegetable
The next time I see a red car 
The next time I handle money

The next time I read something other than this list 
The next time I check the time
The next time I notice myself daydreaming 
The next time I hear the telephone ringing

The next time I open a door 
The next time I see a bird
The next time I use the toilet after noon 
The next time I see the stars

The next time I see an advertisement
The next time I eat anything after breakfast 
The next time I see a bicycle
