The [[Water]]is removed from the tope of the [[xylem]] vessels into the [[mesophyll cells]] down the water potential gradient. The push of water upwards is aided by the root pressure which is where of action of the [[endodermis]] moving minerals into the xylem by [[Active site]], drives water into the xylem by [[Osmosis]], thus pushing it upwards

The flow of water is also maintained with the help of [[Cohesion and surface tension|surface tension]] of water and the attractive forces between water molecules known as [[Cohesion and surface tension|cohesion]]. The action of these 2 forces in combination is known as the tension-cohesion theory, which is further supported by capillary action where the forces involved in cohesion cause the water molecule to adhere to the walls of xylem, thus pulling water up
