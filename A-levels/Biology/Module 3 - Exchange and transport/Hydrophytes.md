Plants that actually live in [[Water]] such as water lilies. As such they need their own adaptions for this environment. They have a very thin or absent waxy cuticle as they don't need to conserve water. Many constantly open stomata are found on the upper surfaces of leaves to maximise gas exchange. Wide, flat leaves give a large surface area for light absorption. Air sacs are found in some hydrophytes to enable leaves to stay afloat. Many large air spaces to make leaves and stems more buoyant.
