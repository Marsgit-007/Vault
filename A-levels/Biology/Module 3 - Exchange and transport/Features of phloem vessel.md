+ They are tubes of living cells
+ Involved in [[translocation]]
+ Consist of sieve tube elements and companion cells
+ Sieve tube elements form a tube to transport [[sugars]] such as [[Sucrose]], in the dissolved form of sap. This transport can be upwards or downwards
+ Companion cells are involved in [[ATP]] production for active processes such as loading sucrose into sieve tubes
+ [[cytoplasm]] of sieve tube elements and companion cells is linked through structures known as plasmodesmata which are gaps between cell walls which allow communication and flow of substances such as minerals between the cells
