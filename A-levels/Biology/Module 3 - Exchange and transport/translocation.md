Translocation is an energy requiring process which serves as a means of transporting assimilates such as [[Sucrose]] in the [[phloem]] between sources which release sucrose such as leaves and sinks e.g. roots and [[meristem]] which remove sucrose from the phloem

Sucrose enters the phloem in a process known as active loading where companion cells use [[ATP]] to transport hydrogen ions into the tissue, thus creating a [[Diffusion]] gradient, which causes the H+ ions to diffuse back into the companion cells. It is a form of [[Facilitated diffusion]] involving cotransporter [[Proteins]] which allows the returns of H+ ions to bring sucrose molecules into the companion cells, thus causing the concentration of sucrose in the companion cells to increase. As a result of that, the sucrose diffuses out of the companion cells down the concentration gradient into the sieve tube elements through links  known as plasmodesmata

As sucrose enters the sieve tube elements, the [[Water]] potential inside the tube is reduced therefore causing water to enter via osmosis, as a result increasing the hydrostatic pressure of the sieve tube. Therefore, water moves down the sieve tube from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Eventually, sucrose is removed from the sieve tube elements by diffusion or [[active transport]] into the surrounding cells, thus increasing the water potential in the sieve tube. This in turn means that water leaves the sieve tube by osmosis, as a result reducing the pressure in the phloem at the sink. Therefore, in summary the mass flow of water from the source to the sink down the hydrostatic pressure gradient is a means of supplying assimilates such as sucrose to where they are needed
