during inspiration, the external [[intercostal muscles]] contract whereas the internal ones relax, as a result the [[ribs]] raise upwards. The [[diaphragm]] contracts and flattens. In combination, the intercostal muscles and diaphragm cause the volume inside the [[thorax]] to increase, thus lowering the pressure. The difference between the pressure inside the [[lungs]] and the atmospheric pressure creates a gradient, thus causing air to enter the lungs
