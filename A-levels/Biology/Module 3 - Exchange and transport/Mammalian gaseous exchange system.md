The gaseous exchange system in mammals consists of the [[lungs]] and associated airways that carry air into and out of the lungs. the lungs are a pair of inflatable sacs lying in the chest cavity. Air can pass into the lungs through the nose and along the [[trachea]] (windpipe), [[bronchi]] and [[bronchioles]]. Finally it reaches tiny air-filled sacs called [[alveoli]]. These are the surfaces where the exchange of gases takes place

The lungs are protected by the [[ribs|ribcage]]. The ribs are held together by [[intercostal muscles]]. The action of these muscles and the [[diaphragm]] helps to produce breathing movements
