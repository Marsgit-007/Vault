Plants require a transport system to ensure that all the cells of a plant receive a sufficient amount of nutrients. This is achieved through the combined action of [[xylem]] tissue which enables [[Water]] as well as dissolved minerals to travel up the plant in the passive process of [[transpiration]], and the phloem tissue which enables [[sugars]] to reach all parts of the plant in the active process of translocation
