The need for specialised exchange surfaces arises as the size of the organism, and its surface area to volume ratio decreases. In the case of single celled organisms, the substances can easily enter the cell as the distance that needs to be crossed over is short. However, in multicellular organisms that distance is much larger due to lower surface area to volume ratio. As a result of that , multicellular organisms required specialised exchange surfaces for efficient gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen

Features of an efficient exchange surface include large surface area, for instance the [[Root hair cells]] or folded membranes, such as those of the [[Mitochondria]]. An efficient exchange surface should also be thin to ensure that the distance that needs to be crossed by the substance is short. The exchange surface also requires a good blood supply/ventilation to maintain a steep gradient, for example that of the [[alveoli]].
