Xerophytes are plants adapted to living in dry conditions. They are able to survive in such conditions because of various adaptions which serve to minimise the [[Water]] loss. The adaptions include smaller leaves which reduce the surface area for water loss. Both densely packed [[mesophyll cells]] and thick waxy cuticles prevent water loss via evaporation. Moreover, xerophytes respond to low water availability by closing the [[stomata]] to prevent water loss. Apart from this, they contain hairs and pits which serve as a means of trapping moist air, thus reducing the water vapour potential. Xerophytes also roll the leaves to reduce the exposure of lower epidermis to the atmosphere, thus trapping air.
