- **Air Enters Through [[Spiracles]]** – Small openings called spiracles on the insect's body allow oxygen to enter while also regulating water loss.
    
- **[[Tracheae]] Transport Air** – The spiracles lead into a network of tubes called tracheae, which transport oxygen deeper into the insect's body.
    
- **[[Tracheoles]] Deliver Oxygen** – The tracheae branch into smaller tubes called tracheoles, which extend directly to individual cells, ensuring efficient oxygen delivery.
    
- **Gas Diffusion into Cells** – Oxygen dissolves in a small amount of [[tracheal fluid]] at the end of tracheoles and diffuses into the surrounding cells for respiration.
    
- **Carbon Dioxide Diffusion** – Carbon dioxide, a waste product of respiration, diffuses out of the cells into the tracheoles and then into the tracheae.
    
- **Expulsion Through Spiracles** – The carbon dioxide is expelled through the spiracles when they open, completing the gas exchange cycle
