The rate of transpiration can be investigated with the help of a potometer where [[Water]] vapour lost by the leaf is replaced by water in the capillary tube. Therefore, measuring the movement of the meniscus can be used to determine the rate of transpiration. 
[[Factors which affect the rate of transpiration]]
