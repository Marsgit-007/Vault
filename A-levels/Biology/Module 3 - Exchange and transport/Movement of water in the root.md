[[Water]] enters through [[root hair cells]] and moves into the xylem tissue located in the centre of the root. This movement occurs as a result of a water potential gradient, as the water potential is higher inside the soil than inside the root hair cells, due to to the dissolved substances in the cell sap.

Therefore, the purpose of root hair cells is to provide a large surface area for the movement of water to occur.

Minerals are also absorbed through the root hair cells by [[Active transport]], as they need to be pumped against the concentration gradient. 

There are no 2 ways the water taken up by the root hair cells can move across the cortex of the root into [[xylem]]. It can either occur via the [[symplast pathway]] or the [[apoplast pathway]]

Therefore, in order for the water to cross the [[endodermis]], the water that has been moving through the cell walls must now enter the symplast pathway

Once it has moved across the endodermis, the water continues down the water potential gradient from cell to cell until it reaches a pit in the xylem vessel which is the entry point of water
