The transpiration stream, which is the movement of water up the stem, enables processes such as [[photosynthesis]], growth and elongation as it supplies the plant with water which is necessary for all these processes. Apart from this, the transpiration stream supplies the plant with the required minerals, whilst enabling it to control it temperature via the evaporation of [[Water]]

Transpiration involves [[Osmosis]], where water moves from the [[xylem]] to the [[mesophyll cells]]. Transpiration also involves evaporation from the surface of mesophyll cells into intercellular spaces and [[Diffusion]] of water vapour down a water vapour potential gradient out of the [[stomata]]
