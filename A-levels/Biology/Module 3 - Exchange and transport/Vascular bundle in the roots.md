+ [[xylem]] and [[phloem]] are components of the vascular bundle, which serves to enable transport of substances as well as for structural support
+ The xylem vessels are arranged in an X shape in the centre of the vascular bundle
+ This enables the plant to withstand various mechanical forces such as pulling
+ The X shape arrangement of xylem vessels is surrounded by [[endodermis]]
+ An inner layer of [[meristem]] tissue known as the pericycle
