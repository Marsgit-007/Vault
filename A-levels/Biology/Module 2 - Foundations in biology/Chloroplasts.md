| they are found only in plant cells and in some protctists                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | the first stage of [[photosynthesis]], when light is trapped by [[chlorophyll]] and used to make [[ATP]] occurs in the grana. [[Water]] is also split to supply hydrogen ions                                          |
| they are surrounded by a double membrane or envelope. The inner membrane is continuous with stacks of flattened membrane sacs called [[thylakoids]] (resembling piles of plates) which contain [[chlorophyll]]. Each stack or pile of thylakoids is called a [[granum]]. The fluid filled matrix is called the stroma | The second stage when hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide using energy from [[ATP]] to make [[Carbohydrates]] occurs in the stroma. Chloroplasts are abundant in leaf cells, particularly the [[palisade mesophyll]] layer |
| Chloroplasts contain loops of [[DNA]] and [[Starch]] grains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
