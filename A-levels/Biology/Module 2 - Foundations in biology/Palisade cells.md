most basic plant cell type, contain many chloroplasts and are specialised for [[photosynthesis]]

They are well adapted for photosynthesis because:
+ They are long and cylindrical, so that they pack together quite closely but with a little space between them or air to circulate; carbon dioxide in these air spaces diffuses into the cells
+ They have a large [[Vacuole]] so that the [[Chloroplasts]] are positioned nearer to the periphery of the cell, reducing the [[Diffusion]] distance for carbon dioxide
+ They contain many chloroplasts - the organelles that carry out photosynthesis
+ They contain [[cytoskeleton]] threads and [[motor proteins]] to move the chloroplasts - nearer to the upper surface of the leaf, when sunlight is lower, but further down when it is high
