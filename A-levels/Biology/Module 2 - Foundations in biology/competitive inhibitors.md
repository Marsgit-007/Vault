are similar in structure to the substrate molecule therefore they bind to the [[Active site]] of the [[enzymes|enzyme]], decreasing its activity as they compete with substrate for the enzyme. The amount of product formed remains the same, however the rate at which product formation occurs decreases. The higher the concentration of competitive inhibitor the lower the reaction rate. Increasing the substrate reverses the effect of competitive inhibitors by outcompeting them
