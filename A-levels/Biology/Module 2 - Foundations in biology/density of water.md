Maximum density of water is at 4 degrees - this means that ice is less dense than water and floats on top of it creating an insulating layer, this increases the chance of survival of organisms in large bodies of water as it prevents them from freezing. Because of their polar nature the water molecules align themselves in a structure which is less dense than liquid water

Water is incompressible therefore it provides good support

Because ice is less dense than water:
+ Aquatic organisms have a stable environment in which to live through the winter
+ Ponds and other bodies of water are insulated against extreme cold. The layer of ice reduces the rate of heat loss from the rest of the pond
