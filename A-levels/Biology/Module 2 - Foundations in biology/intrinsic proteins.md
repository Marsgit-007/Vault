Intrinsic [[Proteins]] are fully embedded in the [[fluid mosaic model|membrane]] from one side to the other. Because they pass right through the [[Phospholipids|phospholipid]] bilayer, intrinsic proteins have hydrophobic [[Amino acids]] on the outside surfaces of the protein. These hydrophobic amino acids can interact with the hydrophobic fatty acid tails in the phospholipid bilayer.
