Formed from from subunits of the [[Proteins|protein]] tubulin. Tubulin sub units assemble to form tubulin [[polymers]] which then form hollow microtubules. These microtubules play a number of roles:
+ Involved in the movement of organelles, for example vesicle movement during secretion
+ Form the the spindle fibres in the movement of [[chromosomes]] in [[mitosis]] and [[Meiosis]]
+ by forming a complex network in the [[cytoplasm]], microtubules help to determine the shape of cells
