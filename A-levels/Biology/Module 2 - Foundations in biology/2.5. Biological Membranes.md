All cells and organelles are surrounded by a partially permeable membrane composed of a sea of [[phospholipids]] with protein molecules between the phospholipid molecules. The main function of the membrane is controlling the movement of substances in and out of the cell organelle. However, it also contains receptors for other molecules such as hormones and enables adjacent cells to stick together. The fluidity of the membrane and the mosaic arrangement of the protein give the structure of the membrane its name - [[fluid mosaic model]]
