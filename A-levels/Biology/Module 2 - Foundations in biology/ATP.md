+ Energy is released when ATP is hydrolysed to form ADP and a phosphate molecule. This process is catalysed by ATP hydrolase
+ The inorganic phosphate can be used to phosphorylate other compounds, as a results of making them more reactive 
+ condensation of ADP and inorganic phosphate catalysed by ATP synthase produces ATP during [[photosynthesis]] and [[respiration]]
