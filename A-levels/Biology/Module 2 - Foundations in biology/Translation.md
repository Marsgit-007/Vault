During Translation amino acids join together to form a polypeptide chain

+ mRNA attaches to a [[ribosomes|ribosome]] and tRNA collects [[Amino acids]] from the [[cytoplasm]] and carries them to the ribosome. tRNA is a single stranded molecule with a  binding site at one end thus it can only carry one type of amino acid, and a triplet of bases at the other
+ tRNA attaches itself to mRNA by complementary base pairing - 2 molecules attach to mRNA at a time
+ The [[Amino acids]] attached to 2 tRNA molecules join by a peptide bond and then tRNA molecules detach themselves from the amino acids, leaving them behind
+ This process is repeated thus leading the formation of a polypeptide chain until a stop codon is reached on mRNA and ends the process of protein synthesis
