Unsaturated lipids which can be found in plants contain carbon-carbon double bonds and melt at lower temperatures than saturated fats

The greater the number of unsaturated bonds, the weaker the intermolecular bonds resulting in lower melting point, and as a result of that saturated fats which don't contain any double bonds are solid at room temperature and unsaturated lipids are liquid at room temperature
