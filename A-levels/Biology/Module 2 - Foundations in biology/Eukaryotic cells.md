All living organisms are made of cell, there are several different types of cells, some of them sharing some common features. Humans are made up of eukaryotic cells. All eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and membrane bound organelles. A more detailed structure of cells called the [[ultrastructure]] can be obtained by using a [[microscope]].

Parts of the cells:
[[nucleus]]
[[endoplasmic reticulum]]
[[Golgi apparatus]]
[[Mitochondria]]
[[Chloroplasts]]
[[Vacuole]]
[[Centrioles]]
[[ribosomes]]
[[lysosomes]]
[[Cilia and undulipodia]]
[[cytoskeleton]]
[[cytoplasm]]
