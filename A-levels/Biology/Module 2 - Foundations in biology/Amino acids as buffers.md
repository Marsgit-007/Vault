When dissolved in [[Water]], the amino group and carboxyl group can ionise. This means that the amino group can accept an H+ ion to change from NH2 to Nh3+. the carboxyl group can give up a H+ ion to change from COOH to COO-

The carboxy group acts as an acid, in producing H+ ion

the amino group acts as a base, in accepting H+ ions:
+ At low pH (where there are lots of H+ ions in solutions), the amino acid will accept H+ ions
+ At high pH (where there are fewer H+ ions in solutions), the amino acid will release H+ ions
This means an amino acid has acidic and basic properties, and so is known as amphoteric. In a long chain of amino acids, you will find amino and carboxyl groups on each end, but there are also many on the R-groups of different amino acids

Protein chains can be affected by this amphoteric nature. by accepting and releasing H+ ions, amino acids can help to regulate changes in pH. This is known as buffering. A buffer is a substance which helps to resist large changes in pH
