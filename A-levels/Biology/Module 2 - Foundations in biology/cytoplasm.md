- The cytoplasm is a fluid-like substance present between the cell membrane and [[nucleus]]. It is mainly composed of [[water]] as well as some organic and inorganic substances. It contains a network of threads and microtubules that help the cell to maintain its shape and form. This network is called the [[cytoskeleton]]. The cytoplasm also contains a group of various structures known as cell organelles.
- Some of these organelles are not surrounded by a membrane and are called non-membranous organelles, such as [[ribosomes]] and centrosome. Other organelles are surrounded by a membrane and are called membranous organelles, such as [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi apparatus]], [[mitochondria]], [[lysosomes]], [[vacuole|vacuoles]], and plastids.
