Glycogen is the main energy storage molecules in animals and it's formed from many molecules of [[Î± glucose]] joined together by 1,4 and 1,6 glycosidic bonds. It has a large number of side branches meaning that [[glucose]] and therefore energy, can be released quickly. Moreover, it is a relatively large but compact molecule thus maximising the  amount of energy it can store
