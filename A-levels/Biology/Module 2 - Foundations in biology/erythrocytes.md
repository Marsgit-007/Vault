Erythrocytes carry oxygen from the lungs to respiring cells (Red blood cells). 

Adaptations:
+ They are very small, about 7.5Âµm in diameter, so have a large surface area: Volume ratio. This means that oxygen can diffuse across their membranes and easily reach al regions inside the cell. Their biconcave shape also increases their SA/V ratio
+ They are flexible. A well developed [[cytoskeleton]] allows the erythrocytes to change shape so that they can twist and turn as they travel through very narrow capillaries 
+ Most of their organelles are lost at differentiation, so they have no [[nucleus]], [[Mitochondria]] or [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and very little [[cytoplasm]]. This provides more space for the many haemoglobin molecules housed inside them. Haemoglobin is synthesised within immature erythrocytes, whilst they still have their nucleus, [[ribosomes]] and [[Rough endoplasmic reticulum]]
