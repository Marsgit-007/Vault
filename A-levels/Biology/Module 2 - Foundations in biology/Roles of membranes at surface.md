+ Separates the cell's components from its external environment (in single-celled organisms the environment is its external surroundings; in multicellular organisms, such as humans, each cell's environment is the tissue fluid or cells surrounding it)
+ regulate transport of materials into and out of the cell
+ may contain enzymes involved in specific metabolic pathways
+ has antigens, so that the organism's immune system can recognise the cell as being "self" and not attack it
+ may release chemicals that signal to other cells
