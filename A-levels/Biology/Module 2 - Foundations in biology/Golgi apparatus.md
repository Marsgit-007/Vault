Is a series of fluids filled, flattened and curved sacs with vesicles surrounding the edges. Golgi apparatus processes and packages [[Proteins]] and [[Lipids]]. It also produces [[lysosomes]]

| This consists of a stack of membrane-bound flattened sacs. Secretory vesicles bring materials to and from the golgi apparatus | [[Proteins]] are modified for example by:<br>+ adding sugar molecules to make [[glycoproteins]]<br>+ adding [[Lipids]] molecules to make [[lipoproteins]]<br>+ Being folded into their 3D shape                           |
