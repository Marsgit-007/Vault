- **Description**:
    - In this model, the parental DNA molecule remains completely intact during replication.
    - A new DNA molecule is formed that consists entirely of newly synthesized strands.
- **Outcome**:
    - After one round of replication, there would be one molecule of entirely old (parental) DNA and one molecule of entirely new DNA.
    - After two rounds, there would be one parental molecule and three entirely new molecules.
- **Diagram Representation**:
    - **Generation 1**: Original â†’ (Old, Old) + (New, New)
    - **Generation 2**: (Old, Old) + (New, New) + (New, New) + (New, New)
- **Significance**:
    - This model was proposed but is not observed in nature.
