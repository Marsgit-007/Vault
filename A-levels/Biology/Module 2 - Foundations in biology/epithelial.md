Sheet of cells that serves as a lining/cover a surface. There are 2 types, squamous which are smooth, flat and very thin, fitting closely together to create a smooth surface, such as the lining of blood vessels and cheeks. Whereas ciliated epithelium is composed of column shaped cells containing cilia which form the lining of structures such as trachea and bronchi. The cilia move together to move the mucus produced by goblet cells along. Ciliated epithelium is also found in the oviducts.
