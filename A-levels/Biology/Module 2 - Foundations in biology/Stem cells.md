Stem cells are undifferentiated cells which are genetically identical and have the ability to develop into any of the various kinds of cells. Stem cells have various uses in research and medicine, for instance repair of damaged tissues, treatment of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's as well as studying development.

The process by which a cell specialised to carry out a particular function is known as differentiation. Stem cells can be found in the bone marrow where they differentiate into [[erythrocytes]] and [[neutrophils]].  
Plants retain their ability to differentiate into different types of cells throughout their life. Division of plant cells occurs at a high rate in [[meristem]]. Dividing meristem cells are known as the [[cambium]] and give rise to [[xylem]] and [[phloem]] tissue
