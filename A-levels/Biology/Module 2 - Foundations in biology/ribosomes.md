| Made in the [[nucleolus]], as 2 separate subunits, which pass through the [[nuclear envelope]] into the cell [[cytoplasm]] and then                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                             |

| Ribosomes are bound to the exterior of the RER are mainly for synthesising [[Proteins]] that will be exported outside of the cell. Made of ribosomal [[RNA\|rRNA]]<br>80s - large ribosome found it eukaryotic cells (25nm)<br>70s - smaller ribosome found in prokaryotic cells, [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] |                                                                                                                                                             |
