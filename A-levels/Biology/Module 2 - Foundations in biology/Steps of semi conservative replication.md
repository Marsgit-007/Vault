1) The double helix unwinds and the [[hydrogen bonds]] between the complementary [[DNA organic bases]] break using DNA helicase thus separating the 2 strands of DNA
2) Both strands are used as templates and complementary base pairing occurs between the template strands and free nucleotides
3) Adjacent [[nucleotides]] are joined by phosphodiester bonds formed in condensation reactions using DNA polymerase
