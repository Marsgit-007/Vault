Water is a polar molecule due to uneven distribution of charge within the molecule - the oxygen atom attracts electrons a bit more strongly than the hydrogen atoms. The unequal sharing of electrons give the water molecule a slightly negative charge near its oxygen atom and a slightly positive charge near its hydrogen atoms. There is [[hydrogen bonds in water]]

It is a metabolite in metabolic reactions such as condensation and [[hydrolysis]] which are used in forming and breaking of chemical bonds.
