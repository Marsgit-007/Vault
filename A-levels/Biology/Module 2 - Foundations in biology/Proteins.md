Proteins are large polymers comprised of long chains of Amino acids.
[[Amino acids]] are joined by [[peptide bonds]] formed in condensation reactions. A dipeptide contains 2 amino acids and polypeptides contain 3 or more amino acids.

[[Structure of proteins]] is determined by the order and number of amino acids, bonding present and shape of the protein:

[[Fibrous proteins]]
[[globular proteins]]
