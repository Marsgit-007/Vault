+ Firstly protein channels  are selective for the chemical than can pass through. That means that only certain chemicals can pass through each type of protein channel
+ Secondly while some types of protein channels are always open, other protein channels only open in response to a certain trigger. This could be a chemical binding to the protein channel such as a neurotransmitter or a change in voltage across the membrane
