are usually oval shaped, bound by a double membrane called the envelope. The inner membrane is folded to form projections called cristae with matrix on the inside containing all the [[enzymes]] needed for [[aerobic respiration]]

| These may be spherical, rod shaped or branched and are 2-5Î¼m long                                                           | Mitochondria are the site of [[ATP]] (energy currency) production during [[aerobic respiration]]                                                                                     |
| They are surrounded by 2 membranes with a fluid filled space between them. The inner membrane is highly folded into cristae | They are self replication, so more can be made if the cell's energy needs increase                                                                                                   |
| The inner part of the mitochondrion is a fluid filled matrix                                                                | They are abundant in cells where much metabolic activity takes place, for example in liver cells and at synapses between neurones where neurotransmitter is synthesised and released |
