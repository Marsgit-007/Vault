The order of [[DNA organic bases]] is called the genetic code which consists of triplets of bases, each triplet of bases codes for a particular [[Amino acids]] and is known as a codon. The amino acids are then joined together by a peptide bond and form a polypeptide chain. Therefore, a gene is a sequence of bases on a DNA molecule coding for a sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. However, not all the genome codes for protein - the non coding sections of DNA are called [[introns]] and the coding regions are called [[exons]]
