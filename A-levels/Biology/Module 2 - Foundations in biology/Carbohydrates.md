Carbohydrates are molecules which consist only of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and they are long chains of sugar units called saccharides. There are three types of saccharides - monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides. Monosaccharides can join together to form disaccharides and polysaccharides by glycosidic bonds which are formed in condensation reactions.
