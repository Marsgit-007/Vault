- [[cholesterol]] gives mechanical stability and flexibility. It regulates the fluidity of the plasma membrane. 
- [[glycoproteins]]
- [[Carbohydrates|carbohydrate]] molecules (glycocalyx) on the outside of the membrane are very hydrophilic and attract [[Water]] with dissolved solutes, helping the cell interact with its water environment and obtain dissolved substances
- [[glycolipid]]
- [[intrinsic proteins]]
- [[extrinsic proteins]]
