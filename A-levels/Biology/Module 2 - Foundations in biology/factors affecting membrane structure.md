Lots of weak intermolecular forces between the [[Phospholipids|fatty acid]] tails in the [[fluid mosaic model|phospholipid bilayer]]

If you increase the temperature this increases the kinetic energy of the phospholipids which breaks these bonds and increases permeability because of the big gaps

Denatures [[Carrier proteins]] and [[channel proteins]] which also affects the permeability  

A [[non-polar bond|non-polar]] solvent disrupts the bilayer by breaking the bonds between the non-polar hydrophobic fatty acids. This increases permeability and fluidity and breaks the membrane
