1)  ATP release energy in small. manageable amount so no energy is wasted.
This means that cells do not over heat from wasted heat energy and cells are less likely to run out of resources. In comparison to [[glucose]], this would release large amounts of energy that could result in wasted energy,

2) It is small-and-soluble-to easily transported around the cell. ATP can move around the [[cytoplasm]] with ease to provide energy for chemical reactions within the cell. This is a property ATP has in common with glucose.

3) Only one bond is broken/hydrolysed to release energy, which is why energy release is immediate. Glucose would need several bonds to be broken down to release all its energy.

4) It can transfer-energy-to another molecule by transferring one of its phosphate groups.
ATP can enable phosphorylation, making other compounds more reactive. Glucose cannot do this, as it does not contain phosphate groups. ATP can't pass out of the cell, the cell always has an immediate supply of energy. ATP cannot leave the cell, where as glucose can. This means that all cells have a constant supply Of AT p or ADP +Pi, but a cell can run out of glucose.
