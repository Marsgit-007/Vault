Also known as spermatozoa.
Male gametes, made in the testes throughout a man's life, they are adapted to reach, penetrate and fertilise the ovum i.e. the female gamete

Adaptions:
+ Many [[Mitochondria]] carry out [[aerobic respiration]]. The [[ATP]] provides energy for the [[Cilia and undulipodia|undulipodium (tail)]] to move and propel the cell towards the ovum
+ Because spermatozoa are small but long and thin, they can move easily
+ Once the spermatozoon reaches an ovum, [[enzymes]] are released from the acrosome (a specialised [[lysosomes|lysosome]]). The enzymes digest the outer protective covering of the ovum, allowing the sperm head to enter the ovum
+ The head of the sperm contains the [[haploid]] male gamete [[nucleus]] and very little [[cytoplasm]]
