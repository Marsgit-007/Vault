| Rod like microfilaments made of subunits of the protein actin; they are polymers of actin and each microfilament is about 7nm in diameter | The protein microfilaments within the [[cytoplasm]] give support and mechanical strength, keep the cell's shape stable and allow cell movement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| straight, cylindrical [[microtubules]], made of [[Proteins\|Protein]] subunits called tubulin; about 18-30nm in diameter                  | Microtubules also provide shape and support to cells, and help substances and organelles to move through the cytoplasm within a cell:<br>+ They form the track along which [[Motor proteins]] walk and drag organelles from one part of the cell to another<br>They form the spindle before a cell divides. These spindle threads enable [[chromosomes]] to be moved within the cell<br>+ Microtubules also make up the [[Cilia and undulipodia]] and [[Centrioles]] |
