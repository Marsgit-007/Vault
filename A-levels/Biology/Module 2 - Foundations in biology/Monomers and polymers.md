Monomers are small units which are the components of larger molecules, examples include [[monosaccharides]] (such as [[glucose]]), [[amino acids]] and nucleotides. 

Polymers are molecules made from monomers joined together. A [[condensation reaction]] is a reaction which joins monomers by chemical bonds and it involves the elimination of a [[water]] molecule. [[Hydrolysis]] is the opposite of condensation and its when water is added to break a chemical bond between 2 molecules.
