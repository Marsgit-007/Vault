+ [[Proteins]] are produced on the [[ribosomes]]
+ Proteins which are produced on the surface of the [[Rough endoplasmic reticulum]] are folded and processed in in the [[Rough endoplasmic reticulum]]
+ The proteins are then transported from the [[Rough endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[Golgi apparatus]] in vesicles
+ they are then modified in the [[Golgi apparatus]]
+ [[Golgi apparatus]] packages proteins into vesicles to be transported around the cells where they're required. Some of the [[Proteins]] such as extracellular enzymes leave the cell by [[exocytosis]]
