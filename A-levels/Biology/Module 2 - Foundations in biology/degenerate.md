more than one triplet codes for the same amino acids, this reduces the phenotypic effect of mutations (which are mistakes in the base sequence such as base deletion, insertion or substitution). A change in the [[DNA organic bases]] sequence may alter the amino acid sequence and the [[Proteins]] therefore it can have various effects. Some mutations are harmful such as the mutations which leads to the production of sticky mucus and causes cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anaemia in which a mutated form of haemoglobin distorts the shape of red blood cells
