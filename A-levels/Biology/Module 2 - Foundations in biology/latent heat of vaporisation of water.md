Because the molecules are held together by [[hydrogen bonds]] t has a relatively large latent heat of vaporisation, meaning evaporation of water provides a cooling effect with little water loss. 

For example water can help to cool living things when sweat evaporates and plants are cooled when water evaporates from mesophyll cells
