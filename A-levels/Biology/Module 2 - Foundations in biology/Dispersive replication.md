- **Description**:
    - In this model, the parental DNA strands break into fragments, and the new DNA is synthesized in a dispersed manner.
    - Each resulting DNA molecule is a patchwork of old (parental) and new DNA.
- **Outcome**:
    - After one round of replication, each DNA molecule would consist of interspersed segments of old and new DNA.
    - After subsequent rounds, the proportion of new DNA in each molecule would increase, but each strand would always be a mixture of old and new DNA fragments.
- **Diagram Representation**:
    - **Generation 1**: Original â†’ (Old/New, Old/New) + (Old/New, Old/New)
    - **Generation 2**: (Old/New, Old/New) + (Old/New, Old/New) + (New/New, Old/New) + (New/New, Old/New)
- **Significance**:
    - This model was also proposed but disproven experimentally.
