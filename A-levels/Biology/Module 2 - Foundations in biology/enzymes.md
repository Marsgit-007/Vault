Increase the rate of reaction by lowering activation energy of the reaction they catalyser. [[Active site]] is the area of the enzyme where the reaction with the substrate takes place. Enzymes are specific to substrates, they bind to meaning that only one type of substrate fits into the active site of the enzyme. When the enzyme and substrate form a complex, the structure of the enzyme is altered so that the active site of the enzyme fits around the substrate. This is called induced fit model
