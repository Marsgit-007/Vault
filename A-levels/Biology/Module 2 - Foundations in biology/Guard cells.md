Found in pairs in the epidermis of leaves and are involved in controlling the opening and closing of the stomata. Guard cells contain [[Chloroplasts]] whereas epidermal cells do not. They respond to [[Water]] influx which causes them to alter their shape, causing stoma to open. 

Adaptations:
+ Light energy used to produce [[ATP]]
+ The ATP actively transports potassium ions from surrounding epidermal cells into the guard cells, lowering their water potential
+ water now enters the guard cells rom neighbouring epidermal cells, by [[Osmosis]]
+ the guard cells swell, but at the tips the [[Cellulose cell wall]] is more flexible and it is more rigid where it is thicker. The tips bulge and the gap, the stoma enlarges
+ As these [[stomata]] open, air can enter the spaces within the layer of cells beneath the [[Palisade cells]]
+ Gaseous exchange can occur and carbon dioxide will [[Diffusion|diffuse]] into the palisade cells. As they use it for [[photosynthesis]], this will then maintain a steep concentration gradient
+ Oxygen produced during photosynthesis can diffuse out of the palisade cells into the air spaces and out through the open stomata
