Is a vesicle containing digestive enzymes bound by a single membrane

| These are small bags, formed from the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Each is surrounded by a single membrane                                                                      | Lysosomes keep the powerful hydrolytic enzymes separate from the rest of the cell                                                 |
| They contain powerful hydrolytic (digestive) [[enzymes]]                                                                                                                | Lysosomes can engulf old cell organelles and foreign matter, digest them and return the digested components to the cell for reuse |
| They are abundant in phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages (types of which blood cell) and can ingest and digest invading pathogens such as [[bacteria]] |                                                                                                                                   |
