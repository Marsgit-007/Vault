 During transcription, a molecule of mRNA is made in the [[nucleus]]:

+ [[Hydrogen bonds]] between the complementary bases break and DNA uncoils thus separating the 2 strands
+ One of the [[DNA]] strands is used as a template by RNA polymerase to make the mRNA molecule, the DNA template is called the antisense strand
+ Free [[Nucleotides]] line up by complementary base pairing and adjacent nucleotides are joined by phosphodiester bonds made by RNA polymerase thus forming a single stranded molecule of mRNA
+ mRNA then moves out of the nucleus through a pore and attaches to a ribosome in the cytoplasm which is the site of the next stage of protein synthesis called [[Translation]]
