It has a high specific heat capacity meaning that a lot of energy is required to warm water up therefore minimising temperature fluctuations in living things therefore acts as a buffer.

4.2kJ of energy to raise the temperature of 1kg of water by 1Â° C

+ Living things, including [[Prokaryotic cells]] and [[Eukaryotic cells]] need a stable temperature for [[enzymes|enzyme]] controlled reactions to happen properly
+ Aquatic organisms need a a stable environment in which to live
