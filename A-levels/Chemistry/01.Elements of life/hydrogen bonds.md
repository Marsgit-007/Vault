*Formation*
+ an extension of [[Induced dipole-dipole interactions]] giving even higher boiling points
+ bonds between H and the three most electronegative elements: F, O and N are extremely polar
+ the small sizes of H, F, N and O concentrates the partial charges in a small volume thus leading to a high charge density
+ intermolecular attractions are greater, leading to even higher boiling points
