*Stem*
+ Look for the longest chain of carbon atoms containing the functional group
+ the carbon atoms must be a continuous row
+ use prefixes 
+ ending tells you what type of carbon structure you have; alkanes end in **ANE**

*Side Chain*
+ Carbon based substituents are named before the chain name
+ they have the prefix -yl added to the basic stem (e.g. CH3 is methyl)
+ Number of principal chain from one end so that the side chain is attached to a carbon atoms with the lowest possible number

**If there is more than one side-chain the following rules apply:**

+ Side chain names appear in alphabetical order i.e. butyl, ethyl, methyl propyl
+ number the principal chain from one end to give the lowest numbers
+ each side-chain is given its own number
+ if identical side-chains appear more than once, prefix with di, tri, tetra etch
+ numbers are separated from names by a HYPHEN **2-methylheptane**
+ numbers are separated from numbers by COMMA **2,3-dimethylbutane**

*Example*
![[Pasted image 20241222075710.png]]
+ Longest chain 8 (it is an octane)
+ 3,4,6 are the numbers NOT 3,5,6
+ order is ethyl, methyl and propyl
