+ Different atoms have different electronegativities
+ one will pull the electron pair closer to its end
+ it will be more negative than average, δ−
+ other will be slightly less negative, or more positive, δ+
+ a dipole is induced and the bond is said to be polar
+ the greater the electronegativity difference, the greater the bond polarity
