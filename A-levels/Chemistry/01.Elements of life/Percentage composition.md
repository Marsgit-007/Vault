The percentage composition by mass is found by dividing the mass of an element present by the mass of the compound present, then multiplying by 100. Elemental mass of C and H can be found by allowing the substance to undergo complete combustion

+ Mass of carbon = 12/44 of the mass of C02 produced
+ Mass of hydrogen =  2/18 of the mass of H20
