used to show a simplified organic formula by removing hydrogen atoms from alkyl chains, leaving just a carbon skeleton and associated functional groups

+ each [[Covalent bonding examples|Covalent bond]] is shown by a line 
+ a carbon atom is at the join of lines
+ [[Functional group|Functional groups]] are shown
+ the number of hydrogen atoms on each carbon atom is the difference between the number of lines and 4
