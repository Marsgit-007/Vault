Boiling and melting points are a measure of the energy required to separate the particles in a substance

Bond type is significant

Boiling points tend to be a better measure and show better trends because solids can be affected by the crystal structure as well as the type of bonding 

Units - [[Kelvin]]

Periods - a general increase then a decrease
