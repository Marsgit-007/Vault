+ charged particles will be deflected by a magnetic or electric field 
+ the radius of the path depends on the value of their mass/charge ration (m/z)
+ ions of heavier [[Isotopes]] with large m/z values follow a large radius curve
+ as most ions are singly charged (1+), the path depends on their mass
+ if an ion acquires a 2+ charge it will be deflected more; its m/z value is halved
