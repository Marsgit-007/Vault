+ Orbitals are filled in order of increasing energy
+ Orbitals are not filled in numerical order....
  **1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, etc.**
  *The 4s is filled before the 3d because it is lower in energy*
+ The effect can be explained by assuming the 
  **principal energy levels get closer together as they get further from the nucleus**
+ As a result, the highest energy orbitals in one principal level may be above the lowest in the next level
