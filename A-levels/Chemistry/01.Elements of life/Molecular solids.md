*Iodine:*
At room temperature iodine is a grey solid. However, on gentle warming it produces a purple vapour. This is because iodine is composed of diatomic molecules (I2) existing in an ordered molecular crystal. Each molecule is independent and attracted by weak [[Induced dipole-dipole interactions]]
Therefore little energy is required to separate the iodine molecules
