Lone pairs of electrons have a greater repulsive power than bond pairs so their presence will affect the angles of bond as they push the bond pairs away. The order of repulsive power is

The resulting configuration is based on the number of electron pairs but the actual shape does not include the lone pairs. A [[Water]] molecule is bent despite the fact it has 4 electron pairs around oxygen. 2 of the pairs are lone pairs and are invisible
