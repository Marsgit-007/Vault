*Old*
+ Electrons existed in definite energy levels or shells
+ the levels were concentric rings
+ the further the energy level is from the nucleus, the higher its energy
+ each level held a maximum number of electrons
+ when a level was full up you moved to fill the next level

*New*
Instead of circulating in orbits around the nucleus, electrons were in orbitals
