*background*
+ In most reactions you only want to make one of the resulting products
+ atom economy is a measure of how much of the products are useful

*Example 1*
Calculate the atom economy for the formation of 1,2-dichloroethane C2H4Cl2

*Example 2*
Calculate the atom economy of the formation of nitro benzene C6H5NO2

*Notes*
+ Addition reactions will have 100% atom economy
+ substitution reactions will have less than 100% atom economy
+ elimination reactions will have less than 100% atom economy
+ high atom economy = fewer waste materials
+ reactions may have a high yield but a lower atom economy
