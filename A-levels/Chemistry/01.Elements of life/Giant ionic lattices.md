+ Oppositely charged ions held in a regular 3D lattice by electrostatic attraction
+ Ions pack together in the most efficient way so there is little wasted space
+ the arrangement of ions in a lattice depends on the relative sizes of the ions

The Na+ ion is small enough relative to the Cl- ion to fit in teh spaces so that both ions occur in every plane

Each Na+ is surrounded by 6 Cl- (co-ordination number = 6) and each Cl- is surrounded by 6 Na+ (co-ordination number = 6)
