layers can slide over each other
it is used as a lubricant and in pencils

*Electricity:*
Does conduct electricity
+ Each atom only uses three of its outer shell electrons for bonding to other atoms
+ remaining electron can move through layers allowing the conduction of electricity
+ carbon atoms in diamond use all 4 electrons for bonding so have no free ones
