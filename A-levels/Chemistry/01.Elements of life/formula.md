A formula represents one [[Molecule]] of a compound, or the simplest ratio of the [[Ion|ions]] present. As with [[symbol|symbols]], a formula represents a single particle or one mole of particles

The number of atoms or groups of atoms in a formula is given by putting a small number just below and behind the symbol(s). As the appearance of a symbol indicates one atom is present, a 1 isn't written (you put NaCl not Na1Cl1)

In some formulae, brackets are used to avoid ambiguity. Aluminium sulphate has the formula Al2(SO4)3 to show that there were two Al's to every three SO4's. Without the brackets it would appear as though there were forth three O's ![[Pasted image 20241222213930.png]]
