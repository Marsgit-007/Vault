+ electrons in atoms or molecules are moving at high speeds in orbitals
+ it is possible for more electrons to be on one side of an atom/molecule
+ this forms a dipole where one side is slightly negative, the other slightly positive
+ a dipole in one atom/molecule
+ this forms a dipole where one side is slightly negative; the other slightly positive
+ a dipole in one atom/molecule can then induce a dipole in a neighbouring one

[[dipole dipole diagram]]

*Result:*
+ Atoms/molecules become attracted to each other
+ this makes them harder to separated and gives them higher boiling points

*Trends:*
+ The more electrons there are in an atom/molecule the bigger the effect
