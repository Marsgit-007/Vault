*Reaction with water*
Most group 2 oxides react with [[Water]] to produce the hydroxide

*Hydroxides*
+ Basic strength also increases down group
+ this is because teh solubility increases
+ the metal ions get larger so charge density decreases
+ there is a lower attraction between the OH- ions and large dispositive ions
+ the ions will split away from each other more easily
+ there will be a greater concentration of OH- ions in water
