Where an experiment uses repeated measurements of the same quantity, (e.g. titrations) anomalous readings should be identified. It a titre is clearly outside the range of all other readings, it can be judged as anomalous and should be ignored when the meant titre is calculated

If a plotted graph reveals that a value is anomalous, then it too should be ignored
