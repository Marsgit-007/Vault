 *Melting point* - **Very high** - A large amount of energy must be put in to overcome the strong electrostatic attractions and separate the ions

*Strength* - **Very brittle** - An dislocation leads to layers moving and similarly charged ions being next to each other. The repulsion splits the crystal

*Electrical* -
+ **Do not conduct electricity when solid** - ions are held strongly in the lattice
+ **conduct electricity when molten or in aqueous solution** - The ions become mobile and conduction takes place

*Solubility* - 
+ **Insoluble in [[non-polar bond|non polar]] solvents**
+ **Soluble in water** as it is a polar solvent and stabilises the separated ions
+ energy is needed to overcome the electrostatic attraction and separated the ions
+ stability is achieved by polar water molecules surrounding the ions
