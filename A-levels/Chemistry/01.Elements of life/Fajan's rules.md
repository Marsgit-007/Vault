+ not all [[Ionic]] compounds have high melting points
+ some [[Covalent]] bonded compounds have higher than expected boiling points, this is due to dipoles in their structure
+ reason - in many substances the bonding is not 100% ionic or covalent

The ideal ionic compound has completely separate spherical ions and the electron densities are apart from each other

If the positive ion has a high charge density it can distort the negative ion by attracting the outer shell electrons to given an area of electron density between the 2 species - a bit like a covalent bond
