A problem with measuring atomic radius is that one is not measuring the true radius of an atom. In metals on measures the metallic radius (half the distance between the inter-nuclear distance of what are effectively ions). Covalent radius is half the  distance between the nuclei of atoms joined by a covalent bond. The values are measured by X-ray or electron diffraction

Units - nanometres
Decreases across a given period due to increased nuclear charge attracting the electrons (which are going into the same shell) more strongly

Argon's value cannot be measured as it doesn't form compounds
