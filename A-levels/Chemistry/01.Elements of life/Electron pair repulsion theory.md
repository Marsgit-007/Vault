This is used to predict the shapes of simple molecules and ions by considering the repulsions between pairs of electrons (lone pair and bond pair) within the molecule. It states that

"The shape adopted is the one which keeps repulsive forces to a minimum"

To determine the shape, count up the number of covalent bond pairs and lone pairs around the central atom and work out the shape which keeps the bonds as far apart as possible
