Because of the complexity of organic molecules, there can be more than one structure for a given molecular formula. to work out the structure, one can carry out different tests

*Chemical* - Use chemical reactions to identify the functional groups present

*spectroscopy*:
IR - detects bond types do the absorbance of IR radiation
NMR - gives information about the position and relative numbers of hydrogen atoms present in a molecule
