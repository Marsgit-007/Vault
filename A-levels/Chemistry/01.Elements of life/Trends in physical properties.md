*Atomic size* - Increases down each group - electrons in shells further from the nucleus

*Ionic size* - Increases down the group - nuclear charge exceeds the electronic charge

*Melting point* - Decrease down each group - Metallic bonding gets weaker due to increased size and lower charge density
Each atom contributes two electrons to the delocalised cloud. Melting points tend not to give a decent trend as crystalline structure affects melting points
