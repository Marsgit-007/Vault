*Sulphates*
+ White crystalline solids
+ solubility in [[Water]] decreases down the Group

+ There is little change in the lattice enthalpy BUT
+ as the cation gets larger the hydration enthalpy gets much smaller
+ a larger cation has a lower charge density so is less attracted to water

*Test for sulphates*
+ Barium sulphate's high insolubility is the basis for a laboratory test for sulphates
*Method*
+ Make up a solution of the compound to be tested
+ acidify it with dilute hydrochloric (or nitric) acid *
+ add a few drops of barium chloride solution
+ white precipitate of barium sulphate conforms presence of sulfate ion

* adding acid prevents precipitation of other insoluble ions such as carbonate
