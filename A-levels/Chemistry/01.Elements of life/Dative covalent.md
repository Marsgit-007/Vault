*Theory*:
+ Differs from a covalent bond only in its formation
+ **Both shared electrons of the shared pair are provided by once species (donor)** and it shares the electrons with the acceptor
+ donor species will have lone pairs in their outer shells
+ acceptor species will be short of their "octet" or maximum
