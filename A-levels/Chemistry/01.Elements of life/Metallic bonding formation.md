Metals atoms achieve stability by "offloading" electrons to attain the electronic structure of the nearest noble gas. These electrons join up to form a mobile cloud which prevents the newly formed positive ions from flying apart due to repulsion between similar charges. 

Atoms arrange themselves in regular close packed 3 dimensional crystal lattices

The outer shell electrons of each atom leave to join a mobile "cloud" or "sea" of electrons which can roam throughout the metal. the electron cloud binds and the newly formed positive ions join together
