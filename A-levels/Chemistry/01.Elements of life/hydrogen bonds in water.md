[[water]]:

*Ice*:
+ each water molecule is hydrogen bonded to 4 others in a tetrahedral formation
+ ice has a "diamond-like structure"
+ it is a simple molecular lattice
+ its volume is larger than the liquid water making it
+ when ice melts, the structure collapses slightly and molecules close together
+ they then move a little further apart as they get more energy (warmer)
+ this is why water has a maximum density at 4Â°C and ice floats

*Liquid water*:
+ intermolecular hydrogen bonding gives higher than expected boiling point
+ extra attraction between molecules just below the surface gives a surface tension and causes the meniscus to be the shape it is
