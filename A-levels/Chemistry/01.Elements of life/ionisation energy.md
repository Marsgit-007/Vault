The energy required to remove one mole of electrons (to infinity) from one mole of gaseous atoms to form one mole of gaseous positive ions

+ [[Successive ionisation energies]] get larger as the proton :  electron ration increases

+ Big jumps in value occur when electrons are removed from shells nearer the nucleus - **less shielding** so **more energy** is needed to overcome the attraction

+ If the IE values are very high, covalent bonding is favoured (e.g Beryllium)

Increases across a period - Nuclear charge increases by one each time. Each extra electron, however, is going into the same main energy level so is subject to similar shielding and is a similar distance away from the nucleus. The electrons are held increasingly more strongly and are harder to remove

But Minor differences occur
