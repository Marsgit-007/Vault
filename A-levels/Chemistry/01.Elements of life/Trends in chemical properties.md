*Overall*
+ Undergo redox reactions involving the "loss" of electrons to form 2+ ions
+ reactivity increases down the group due to the ease of cation formation

*Reason*
+ [[ionisation energy|Ionisation energies]] (I.E.) decreases down the group

*Ionisation energy* - decreases down the group - atomic size increases
