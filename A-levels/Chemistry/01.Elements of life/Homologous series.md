A series of organic compounds having the same [[Functional group]] and each member differing from the previous by CH2

+ All share the same general formula
+ formulae differ from their neighbours by CH2 (e.g. CH4, C2H6 ...etc)
+ contain the same functional group(s)
+ have similar chemical properties
+ show a gradual change in physical properties as molar mass increases 
+ can usually be prepared by similar methods
