*Boiling point*
+ increases with molecular mass/size - increased [[Induced dipole-dipole interactions]]
+ for isomers the greater the degree of branching, the lower the boiling point
+ the lower the members of the series are gases are [[RTP]] - cyclohexene is a liquid

*Solubility*
+ [[non-polar bond|non polar]] so they are insoluble in [[Water]] but soluble in organic solvents
