+ Due to restricted rotation of the carbon-carbon double bond
+ single bonds can rotate so the groups around them are not "frozen" in position
+ double bonds can't rotate freely, thus "freezing" groups on either side of C=C
+ not all [[Alkenes]] exhibit this type of isomerism
+ if there are 2 H's and 2 non-hydrogen groups attached to each carbon it is called cis-trans isomerism
