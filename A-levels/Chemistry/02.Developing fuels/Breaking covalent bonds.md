There are 2 ways to split the shared pair of electrons in an unsymmetrical [[Covalent]] bond:
+ [[Heterolytic fission]]
+ [[Homolytic splitting]]

If several bonds are present the weakest bond is usually broken first:
+ Energy to break bonds can come from a variety of sources such as heat and light
+ in the reaction between methane and chlorine either can be used but in the laboratory a source of UV light (or sunlight) is favoured
