Many important industrial processes involve heterogeneous catalysis, where the reactants and the catalyst are in different physical states.

This usually involves a mixture of gases or liquids reacting in the presence of a solid catalyst. 

When a solid catalyst is used to increase the rate of a reaction between gases or liquids, the reaction occurs on the surface of the solid. The reactants form bonds with atom on the surface of the catalyst - they are adsorbed onto the surface. as a result, bonds in the reactant molecules are weakened and break. New bonds form between the reactants, held close together on the surface, to form the products. This in turn weakens the bonds to the catalyst surface and the product molecules are released. 

It is important that the catalyst has a large surface area for contact with reactants. For this reason, solid catalysis are used in a finely divided form or as a fine wire mesh. Sometimes that catalyst is supported on a porous material to increase its surface area and prevent it from crumbling. This happens in the catalytic converters fitted to car exhaust systems. 

Many of the heterogeneous catalyst used in industrial processes are transition metals or transition compounds. 

Some example of heterogeneous catalysts are platinum and rhodium in [[catalytic converters]] in cars and the use of nickel powered in the hydrogenation of unsaturated oils to give [[Saturated lipids|saturated fats]]
