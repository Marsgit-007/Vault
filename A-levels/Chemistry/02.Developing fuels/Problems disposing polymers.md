Although polymers derived from [[Alkenes]] are invaluable to modern society, their disposal creates widespread problems. 

+ If they are unreactive to most chemicals and bacteria (non-biodegradable)
+ If they are just discarded they add to the landfill problem

**Recycling**
+ High cost of collection and re-processing
+ the different types of polymer have to be separated

**Burn waste**
+ saves on landfill sites and produces energy
+ toxic fumes (HCl) can be removed by "scrubbing" from burning chlorinated polymers such as poly(chloroethene)

**Feedstock**
+ use the waste for the production of useful organic compounds
+ new technology can convert waste into hydrocarbons
+ hydrocarbons can then be turned back into polymers
