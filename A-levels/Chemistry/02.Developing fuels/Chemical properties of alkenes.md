*Theory*
+ Spatial arrangement around the C=C is planar
+ The bond angles are 120°

Three of the four electrons of carbon sp2 hybridised and the remaining electrons exists in a 2p orbital at right-angles to the three sp2 orbitals

The 2p orbitals overlap to form a new pi (π) orbitals; it exists above and below the plane of the carbon-carbon bond

+ the main reactions in alkenes is [[electrophilic addition]]
+ electrophiles are electron pair acceptors
+ electrophiles are attracted to the electron rich carbon-carbon double bond
