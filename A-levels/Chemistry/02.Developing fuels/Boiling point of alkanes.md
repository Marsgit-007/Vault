+ Increases as they get more carbon atoms in their formula
+ the more atoms there are the greater the [[Induced dipole-dipole interactions]]
+ greater intermolecular force = more energy needed to separate the molecules
+ the more energy required, the higher the boiling point

+ straight chains have larger surface areas giving greater molecular interaction
+ branched molecules are more compact and have less intermolecular attraction
+ the lower the intermolecular forces, the lower the boiling point
