*Preparation*
Many are prepared by a [[free radicals|free radical]] process involving high pressure, high temperature and a catalyst. The catalyst is usually a substance (an organic peroxide) which readily breaks up to form radicals which initiate a chain reaction. 
Another famous type of catalyst is a Ziegler-Natta catalyst (named after the scientist who developed it). Such catalysts are based on the compound TiCl4
