Energy required to break one mole of gaseous bonds to form gaseous atoms

**[[Endothermic]]** - energy must be put in to break a chemical bond

*notes:*
+ the strength of a bond depends on its environment so MEAN values are quoted
+ making a bond is an [[Exothermic]] process as it is the opposite of breaking a bond
+ for diatomic gases, the bond enthalpy is twice the enthalpy of atomisation
+ the smaller the bond enthalpy, the weaker the bond and easier it is to break
