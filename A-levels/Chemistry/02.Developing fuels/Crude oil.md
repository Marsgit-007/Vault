In the past, most important organic chemicals were derived from coal. Nowadays, natural gas and crude petroleum provide an alternative source

+ the composition of crude petroleum varies according to its source
+ It is a dark coloured, viscous liquid
+ Consists mostly of [[Alkanes]] with up to 40 carbon atoms + [[Water]], sulphur and sand
+ can be split up into fractions by [[fractional distillation]] 
+ distillation separates the compounds according to their boiling point
+ at each level a mixture of compounds in a similar boiling range is taken off
+ rough fractions can then be distilled further to obtain narrower boiling ranges
+ some fractions are more important - usually the lower boiling point ones
+ high boiling fractions may be broken down into useful lower ones - [[Cracking]]
