*Physical*
Can be varied by changing the reaction conditions (pressure, temperature etc)

*Chemical*
Chemical properties are based on the [[Functional group|functional groups]] within their structure

e.g. poly(ethene) is typical; it is fairly inert as it is basically a very large [[Alkanes|alkane]]. This means it is resistant to chemical attack and non-biodegradable
