*Theory*
Imagine that, during a reaction, all the bonds of reacting species are broken and the individual atoms join up again but in the form of products. The overall energy change will depend on the difference between the energy required to break the bond and that released as bonds are made

**energy released making bonds > energy used to break bonds** - [[Exothermic]]

**energy used to break bonds > energy released making bonds** - [[Endothermic]]
