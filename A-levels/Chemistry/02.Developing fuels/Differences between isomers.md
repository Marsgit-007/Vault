*Boiling point*
+ "straight" chain isomers have higher boiling points than branched chain isomers
+ the greater the degree of branching the lower the boiling point
+ branching decreases the effectiveness of intermolecular attractive forces
+ less energy has to be put in to separate the molecules
+ boiling points also vary between isomers containing different [[Functional group]]s
  e.g. [[Alcohols]] and ethers - due to [[permanent dipole-dipole interactions]] or [[hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]]

*Chemical properties*
Most isomers show similar chemical properties if the same functional group is present. However, it is best to have a look at each structure and apply any knowledge of the chemical reactions of the compounds in question
