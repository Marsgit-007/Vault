*Occurrence*
+ another form of stereoisomerism
+ occurs when compounds have non-superimposable mirror images

*existence*
+ The two different forms are known as optical isomers or enantiomers and occur when molecules have a chiral centre
+ to find such a centre, look for an asymmetric carbon atom - one with 4 different atoms, or arranged tetrahedrally around it

+ two forms exist which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; i.e. you can't stack one form exactly on top of the other

*difference*
+ Isomers differ in their reaction to plane-polarised light
+ one isomer rotates right to the right, and the other to the left
+ rotation of light is measured using a [[polarimeter]]
+ Rotation is measured by observing the polarised light as it emerges towards the observer. If light appears to have...
