*Background*
The Russian scientist, Markownikoff, investigated the products of the addition of hydrogen halides to [[Alkenes]]. he found that, when 2 products were formed, one was formed in a larger quantity. His original rule was based only on this reaction. The up-to-date version of Markownikoff's rule uses [[carbocations|carbocation]] stability as a criterion for predicting the products

It states that "**In [[electrophilic addition]] to [[Alkenes]] the major product is formed via the more stable carbocation** (carbonium ion)"

In the the below reaction, path A involves a 2° carbocation, path B a 1° carbocation. As the 2° ion is more stable, the major product (i.e. 2-bromopropane) is formed via that route
